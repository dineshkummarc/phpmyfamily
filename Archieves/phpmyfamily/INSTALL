Preamble
========

Please read the LICENSE file included with this distribution.

phpmyfamily is intended to allow geographically dispersed family members
to maintain a central database of research which is readily accessable and editable.
It allows family members to contribute as and when information becomes available
without requiring them to send it to a central 'custodian.'  At the same time,
it allows the general public to view your tree (subject to the restrictions below)
to see if they match.

Infomation regarding the identities of people born after 01/01/1910 are hidden from
general browsing but are freely available to 'registered' users.

As well as maintaining links for parents, siblings, spouses and children, there are
free text capabilities for the recording of anecdotes, information etc, recording of
census details, capability to upload images and document transcripts.  Please note that
html tags in the notes field WILL be rendered.

phpmyfamily is NOT intended to provide a 'all the worlds related' database with
many users working on separate trees aka familyreunited.com.  While there is no
requirement for individuals in the database to be linked into a central structure,
all users can see all records etc.
